# Text-Analytics-Using-NLTK
Text analytics is the automated process of translating large volumes of unstructured text into quantitative data to uncover insights, trends, and patterns. Combined with data visualization tools, this technique enables companies to understand the story behind the numbers and make better decisions.


# Natural Language Processing(NLP)
Natural Language Processing(NLP) is a part of computer science and artificial intelligence which deals with human languages.
In other words, NLP is a component of text mining that performs a special kind of linguistic analysis that essentially helps a machine “read” text. It uses a different methodology to decipher the ambiguities in human language, including the following: automatic summarization, part-of-speech tagging, disambiguation, chunking, as well as disambiguation and natural language understanding and recognition.


# NLTK
NLTK consists of the most common algorithms such as tokenizing, part-of-speech tagging, stemming, sentiment analysis, topic segmentation, and named entity recognition. NLTK helps the computer to analysis, preprocess, and understand the written text.

1. Tokenization: It is the process of breaking strings into tokens which in turn are small structures or units. Tokenization involves three steps which are breaking a complex sentence into words, understanding the importance of each word with respect to the sentence and finally produce structural description on an input sentence.
2. Stemming: Stemming usually refers to normalizing words into its base form or root form.
3. Part of speech: Part-of-speech tagging is used to assign parts of speech to each word of a given text (such as nouns, verbs, pronouns, adverbs, conjunction, adjectives, interjection) based on its definition and its context. 
4. Lemmatization: In simpler terms, it is the process of converting a word to its base form. The difference between stemming and lemmatization is, lemmatization considers the context and converts the word to its meaningful base form, whereas stemming just removes the last few characters, often leading to incorrect meanings and spelling errors.
5. Stop Words: “Stop words” are the most common words in a language like “the”, “a”, “at”, “for”, “above”, “on”, “is”, “all”. These words do not provide any meaning and are usually removed from texts. We can remove these stop words using nltk library
6. Chunking: Chunking means picking up individual pieces of information and grouping them into bigger pieces. In the context of NLP and text mining, chunking means a grouping of words or tokens into chunks.
